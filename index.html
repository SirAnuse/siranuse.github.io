- <b>Added three more PvP maps</b><br>
-- <i>Ruthven's Arena, a 4p duo map.</i><br>
-- <i>Shaitan's Arena, a 3p FFA map.</i><br>
-- <i>Paradise Arena, a 4p FFA map.</i><br>
<br>
- <b>Reduced UT drop rates in the standard PvP chests</b><br>
-- <i>I felt that there wasn't much incentive to loot after you got the good stuff</i><br>
-- <i>New UT chests now spawn near the center of the map, with higher UT drop rates and to incentivise going to the center of the map</i><br>
-- <i>Mini-consumable chests spawn too, and drop HP Pots, Ghost Pirate Rums, and Speed Sprouts.</i><br>
- <b>With the introduction of mini-consumable chests, HP pots can be consumed during PvP</b><br>
-- <i>You still can't buy them, though, and your HP and MP pot amounts will be reset upon entering the arena.</i><br>
- <b>Fixed minor PvP bug where shots wouldn't go through players in PvP while you weren't in PvP</b><br>
-- <i>That was a mouthful</i>
<br>
- <b>Fixed Armour Piercing not being purple</b><br>
-- <i>This was because I moved the damage packet to the serverside, and client didn't like that</i><br>
- <b>Also fixed a bug where you couldn't join the same PvP arena twice</b><br>
-- <i>Wasn't flushing the dictionaries, oops</i><br>
